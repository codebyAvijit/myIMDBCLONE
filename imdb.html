          Set within a year after the events of Batman Begins (2005), Batman,
          Lieutenant James Gordon, and new District Attorney Harvey Dent
          successfully begin to round up the criminals that plague Gotham City,
          until a mysterious and sadistic criminal mastermind known only as "The
          Joker" appears in Gotham, creating a new wave of chaos. Batman's
          struggle against The Joker becomes deeply personal, forcing him to
          "confront everything he believes" and improve his technology to stop
          him. A love triangle develops between Bruce Wayne, Dent, and Rachel
          Dawes.
